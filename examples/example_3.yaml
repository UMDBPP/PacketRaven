# this configuration tells PacketRaven to perform the following functions:
#  1. read packet information from several sources once every 30 seconds, including
#    - https://aprs.fi
#    - a USB port at `/dev/ttyUSB0`
#    - a text file at `~/packets.txt`
#    - a PostGreSQL database at `bpp.umd.edu`
#  2. filter by specific callsigns and constrain to a specific time range
#  3. provide CUSF prediction information with the given parameters
#  4. output packets to a GeoJSON file at `./example_3.geojson`
#  3. output information to the console and to `./example_3.log`
#
# you can run this configuration with the following: `packetraven examples/example_3.yaml`
